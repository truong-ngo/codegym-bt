After playing keyboards in several heavy metal bands in the 1990s, including Darkwoods My Betrothed, Tuomas Holopainen decided to create his own project while sitting around a campfire with friends on July 6, 1996.[20][21][22] He immediately had a clear idea of the music: experimental acoustic music he had written himself during his time in the Finnish Army,[21] similar to the music usually played around campfires, but with a distinct sound and atmosphere[3] and played on his keyboards.
